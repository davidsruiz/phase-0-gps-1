# Release 7

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I still had some questions about the proper Git/Github workflow.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
These concepts were clarified during the session as me and my peer traded ideas and discussed while using the workflow over and over. This repetitive process reinforced not just the steps but the reason for them and how they can be used in other ways.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked many small questions to my peer and the guide was always there to help in case we got stumped. But the main thing I learned from them today was about the technicallity and use cases of Fetch and Merge. 

* What still confuses you about Git?
I'm still not sure how the Git version control system treats things other than text. In my experimenting, upon pushing to github , my image files were not rendered correctly.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was really helpful. I think I agree with most people by saying that closley working, building, learning with a peer helps deepen the understanding of the matierial and brings to light any uncovered questions. It was also enjoyable to be interacting with more than just machine and to be trading points of view and technique.
