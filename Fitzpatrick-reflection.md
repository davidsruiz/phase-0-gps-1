# Release 7

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I was kind of struggling with the many different steps required in a proper git workflow and avoiding fear that I was doing things incorrectly. For example, I never knew when the proper time to pull from the master branch to update it was. I'm also struggling with deleting feature branches on GitHub; sometimes I press "delete branch," but locally the branch still comes up even after I sync the master branch with GitHub.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Some of the theory behind Git and GitHub, such as local vs. remote and what pull, clone, and other commands were doing relative to these spaces were clarified. I am also much more comfortable with GitHub commands, and they come more naturally to me now.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked my pair about the three different stages of Git that the Dev videos showed me (untracked, modified, staged) and how to clarify them; I was happy to learn both my guide and partner were a bit confused, and my guide just told me to focus on making, adding, and committing changes.

What still confuses you about Git?

When to properly push and pull still confuses me. Everytime you switch onto the master branch, must you pull? What if your local master branch is far ahead of the remaote one?

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I had a really great experience pairing! My partner was great: very flexible, intelligent, and kind. I would love to work with him again!
